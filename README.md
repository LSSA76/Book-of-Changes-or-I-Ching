# Book-of-Changes-or-I-Ching

The Book of Changes or I Ching is an ancient chinese oracle book. The idea is that you ask a question and receive an answer. But the book is generally viewed as hard to use and understand. This program aims to make it more accessible and easy to use by making the process of extracting the answer automatic. The program is filled with help as you move along.
