# Book-of-Changes-or-I-Ching

More than 5,000 years old, the I Ching is a book of oracles that contains the whole of human experience. By asking it simple or complex questions, this means of divination helps us to explore the unconscious through the symbolism of hexagrams.

These hexagrams guide us towards the solutions of difficult problems and life situation - whatever question we may ask. However, the I Ching may also be read as a book of wisdom revealing the laws of life and how we must listen to them if we are to live in peace and harmony with the world about us.

 - "A great and singular book ... for lovers of self-knowledge, of wisdom - if there be such - it seem to be the right book." Carl Jung
  
 - "Unquestionably one of the most important book in the world's literature. It opens to the reader the richest treasure of Chinese    wisdom." Aryan Path

 - "Far Eastern culture cannot be understood without a knowledge of the I Ching ... this is certainly the best popular exposition of the book." The Times
